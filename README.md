# Adler Barroso Ferreira
<sub>*Insurance Renewal* at Sicoob Corretora </sub>

My job background come from the investment and insurance market, where I learned to analise plenty data of clients and they're assets.

Spent some time analising stock prices, COE's, assest, fixed income assets and economy index for a good wealth management. 

From that experience came the soft skills, then I realise that I like to analise data and if I started to learn Python and Data Science I could become a great professinal. To achive that, I'm taking classes with Carlos Melo in the course of Sigmoidal: Data Science na Pratica.
